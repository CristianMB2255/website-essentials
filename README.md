## DESCRIPTION
Many people after formatting the computer forget about which software they have installed, which is the best browser to use, which text editor to encode that program or even which version of the operating system they find to install on another computer. Instead of jumping from site to site in search of this information, I developed Essentials, a web tool that shows through list; Softwares that are useful for your computer and that no longer need to stay in your head, so you can worry about other things.

The tool is very easy to use, when accessing the site you can check it in two languages being English and Portuguese, which greatly facilitates for others who are not aware of their local language. In addition to having the night mode installed on it - just click on the moon - which makes it much easier for people who work at night and need that software in a moment of need.

Any question, suggestion or tip, you can use Github, Discord, Steam, Twitter, Instagram or Facebook to communicate, some of these links are in the footer below.
